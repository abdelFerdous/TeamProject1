            <p>
                Preseason has been out for a couple of (long) patches now, and we’ve seen how things have shaken out
                with the new tank Mythics. Our primary goal with these changes was to shift tanks’ farming and damage
                dealing capabilities from Mythics to Legendaries, freeing up their Mythics’ passives for more exciting
                and emblematic tank fantasies.
            </p>
            <p>
                And, after some tuning to Mythics, Sunfire Aegis, and struggling tanks, we believe we’re achieved our
                goals and that the class has reached a healthier place. Not only have tanks adapted well to Preseason
                finding success in both Top and Jungle, but we also expect players to better learn and understand tank
                itemization as time passes. In addition, each of the new Mythics seems to have both powerful individual
                champion users as well as game states they thrive in.
            </p>
            <p>
                That doesn’t mean everything is perfect though. Some items (looking at you Jak’Sho) are being used just
                as well or arguably better by classes other than tanks and not every item is hitting the sweet spot of
                balance and satisfaction we strive for. To be clear, we are ok with classes other than tanks purchasing
                these items, but with a few caveats:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>They should not be the dominant Mythic choice on other classes.</li>
                <li>They should pay a clear damage tradeoff for doing so.</li>
                <li>They should not warp how tank Mythics are balanced on tanks.</li>

            </ul>


            <p>
                Additionally, we are working on some changes for Gargoyle Stoneplate to make it live up to its billing
                as a capstone tank item that will be coming sometime early this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                With those expectations laid out, let's go over our current assessment of the new Mythics:
            </p>
            <h2>
                Heartsteel
            </h2>
            <p>
                <img src="pic/Heartsteal.webp" width="28%">
            </p>
            <p>
                When Heartsteel was first released a lot of players felt the item was too strong. But as time has passed
                it’s become more obvious where the item’s counterplay exists both via in-game tactics and build
                itemization. And the item now seems to be in a relatively balanced state.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re quite happy with its current state and have no significant changes planned as it has already
                proven to be an exciting item to build around for many tanks, as well as being viable on a few other
                champions. That said, we do recognize that it has a high degree of volatility (meaning it has
                <b>really</b>
                high highs and <b>really</b> low lows), but we believe tanks having high moment/pop-off games is
                important.
            </p>
            <h2>Jak'Sho, the Protean</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="pic/Jaksho.webp" width="28%">
            </p>
            <p>
                Jak’Sho has landed in a good spot for tanks, but has also been a very potent one-stop durability shop
                for fighter builds. While there are other factors at play, such as other high efficiency 1st item
                purchases like Ravenous Hydra and Blade of the Ruined King pairing extremely well with Jak’Sho and
                inflating its power on fighters, we ultimately think it’s a little too good on the class as-is which
                risks us having to nerf it for tanks when it seems relatively balanced.
            </p>
            <p>
                We shipped a nerf to address the Fighter outliers in patch 12.23b, and are following up in patch 13.1
                with a minor reshape to the item’s outputs to better favor tanks and defensive purchases while lowering
                its efficiency as a singular durability purchase.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Radiant Virtue
            </h2>
            <p>
                <img src="pic/Randiant Virtue.webp" width="28%">
            </p>
            <p>
                We expected Radiant Virtue to be more niche as, in most cases, it’s a poor item to rush. It’s also a
                more selfless purchase focused around helping your team rather than your individual power, making it
                less popular in Solo queue. It’s currently fulfilling its role well and (a little surprisingly) is a
                powerful item on Top, Jungle, and Support tanks alike (as well as some enchanters). Overall, this item
                is in a fine state and not in urgent need of changes, but there are a couple potential issues we’re
                monitoring:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Radiant is currently very strong on Support tanks. It was intended primarily as a more supportive
                    output for Top/Jungle tanks, but we have no problem with Supports sometimes buying it as long as it
                    doesn’t necessitate us nerfing it for the intended users.</li>
                <li>There’s also potential that it may need to be balanced around Pro play. We’ll have to wait and see
                    how things pan out before we make a proper assessment on this front.</li>
                <li>Because of Radiant’s design, it can be hard to perceive its effect in-game. Periodic AoE effects are
                    hard to keep track of in the middle of a teamfight, especially when they’re applied to your
                    teammates. This problem is admittedly pretty tough to solve, but there might be some small tweaks we
                    can make to make sure Radiant is more satisfying without drastically changing it.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Given these issues we think there are a few potential paths forward:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leave Radiant as is and balance it as a viable option for tanks in any role.</li>
                <li>Shape it to be more reliant on additional health purchases to ensure it remains viable on Top/Jungle
                    users should it need to be nerfed.</li>
                <li>BShape the item as a Support item and potentially move Locket of the Iron Solari to Legendary.</li>
                <li>Minorly rework mechanics to make the item more satisfying/appreciable.</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Iceborn Gauntlet</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="pic/IceBoneGaunlet.webp" width="28%">
            </p>
            <p>
                This one landed in a decent spot from a balance standpoint and has a reasonable breadth of users.
                Overall satisfaction and excitement for the item is lower than we wanted however, so we’ll be exploring
                if there are any small scope changes we could make to the pattern/output of this item to have it better
                match the fantasies of the other tank Mythics.
            </p>
            <p>
                A couple potential directions among many possibilities would be adding a health ratio to the Spellblade
                proc or giving the Iceborn user a bonus effect when inside their own slow zone.
            </p>
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>That’s it! I hope this was an informative rundown of our read on the current state of tank Mythic items.
                We’ll continue to watch and assess how things settle over 13.1, so please keep the feedback coming and
                have fun with the new items!</p>
